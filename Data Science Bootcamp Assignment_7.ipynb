    "1. How do you assess the statistical significance of an insight?\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical significance is assessed using hypothesis testing. This typically involves:\n",
    "Formulating a null hypothesis (H₀) (e.g., no difference or effect).\n",
    "Calculating a p-value — the probability of observing the data (or more extreme) if H₀ is true.\n",
    "Choosing a significance level (α), usually 0.05.\n",
    "If the p-value < α, we reject the null hypothesis, indicating the result is statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may also use confidence intervals and check whether they include a \"null\" value (e.g., 0 for differences or 1 for ratios).\n",

    "Why it’s important:\n",
    "Enables the use of normal-based inference (e.g., z-tests, confidence intervals) even if the population is not normal.\n",
    "Forms the foundation for many statistical methods like A/B testing, confidence intervals, and regression.\n",
